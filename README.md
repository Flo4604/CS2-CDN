# CS2-CDN A easy way to access CS2 images.

A simple script, which downloads all cs2 files and extracts their all images for 
- Stickers
- Patches
- Graffitis
- Character Models
- Music Kits
- Cases
- Tools
- Status Icons ( Medals + Ranks )
- Weapons

Once extracted they will be uplodad to a cloudflare r2 storage. 

You can view the images via `https://cs2cdn.com/` + ItemPath

For Example: https://cs2cdn.com/econ/status_icons/service_medal_2024_lvl1.png

You can get the item paths by using the items_game.txt which is also stored in this repository. See [Here](https://github.com/Flo4604/Cs2-cdn/blob/main/data/scripts/items/items_game.txt)
